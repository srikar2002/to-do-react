<!-- Implemented dashboardService.js — Added a service module with utilities for date conversion (dropdown to date, task date to option), form validation, week view helpers (navigation, date calculations), task permission checks (edit/drag), and task data preparation for API calls.
Refactored Dashboard.js — Separated business logic from UI by replacing inline date conversion with service functions, moving form validation to the service, extracting week view calculations to the service, simplifying drag & drop using service utilities, and reducing component complexity by moving ~200 lines of business logic to the service layer.
Refactored Register.js — Reduced code and improved structure by consolidating form fields into a reusable array, extracting validation into a separate function, replacing 4 TextField components with a .map() loop, reducing file size from 156 to 93 lines (~40% reduction), and maintaining functionality while improving maintainability.
Improved code organization — Applied separation of concerns by moving business logic to the service layer, keeping UI components focused on rendering and user interaction, and centralizing utilities for reuse across the application.
Maintained code quality — All changes pass linter checks, preserve existing functionality, follow established patterns, and improve maintainability and testability. -->
